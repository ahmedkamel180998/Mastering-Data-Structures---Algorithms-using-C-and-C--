### **Understanding Time Complexity and Units of Time**

- Every statement in a program is assumed to take **one unit of time** for execution.
- This approach is similar to how currency works: the exact value may differ in real-world execution, but for analysis, we assume a uniform unit.
- If a statement is repeated multiple times, we count its execution frequency to determine the time complexity.

### **Example of a Recursive Function and Its Execution Time**

- Consider a function that simply prints a value `n`. Printing takes **one unit of time**.
- If the function is recursive and calls itself, we must count the number of times it executes.
- For example:
  - If `n = 3`, the function prints 3 times, taking **3 units of time**.
  - If `n = 5`, it prints 5 times, taking **5 units of time**.
  - For any general `n`, it takes **n units of time**, leading to a time complexity of **O(n)**.

### **Understanding Recurrence Relations for Recursive Functions**

1. **Forming a Recurrence Relation:**

   - The time taken by the function is denoted as `T(n)`.
   - It includes:
     - A conditional statement (`if` check) → **1 unit of time**.
     - A `printf` statement → **1 unit of time**.
     - A recursive call to `fun(n-1)`, which itself takes `T(n-1)` time.
   - Thus, the recurrence relation is:
     \[
     T(n) = T(n-1) + 2
     \]
   - For `n = 0`, only the condition is checked, so `T(0) = 1`.

2. **Solving the Recurrence Relation using the Substitution Method:**
   - Expanding the relation step by step:
     - \( T(n) = T(n-1) + 1 \)
     - \( T(n-1) = T(n-2) + 1 \)  
       Substituting \( T(n-1) \) in the first equation:
     - \( T(n) = T(n-2) + 2 \)
     - \( T(n-2) = T(n-3) + 1 \), substituting this:
     - \( T(n) = T(n-3) + 3 \)
     - Extending this pattern, we generalize:
       \[
       T(n) = T(n-k) + k
       \]
     - To stop the recursion, set \( n - k = 0 \), meaning \( k = n \).
     - Substituting \( k = n \):
       \[
       T(n) = T(0) + n
       \]
     - Since we already established \( T(0) = 1 \):
       \[
       T(n) = 1 + n
       \]
     - This simplifies to **O(n)**.

### **Key Takeaways from the Analysis**

- **Recursion can be analyzed using recurrence relations**, which help derive time complexity.
- **The time complexity of the given function is O(n)**, which aligns with the number of recursive calls.
- **Two methods for determining time complexity were demonstrated:**
  1. **Using the recursion tree** to count function calls.
  2. **Using recurrence relations** to derive complexity algebraically.
- **The number of function calls is `n+1`**, as one extra call is made when `n = 0`.
- **The function executes `n` print statements**, confirming O(n) complexity.

### **Conclusion**

- The discussion introduced **recursion, tracing function calls, stack utilization, and time complexity analysis**.
