You're covering time complexity in great detail! It’s a crucial concept for understanding how algorithms perform as input size grows. Let's summarize and clarify some of the key points you've mentioned:

### **Understanding Time Complexity**

Time complexity refers to how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size (denoted as **n**) increases. It's not about the actual time in seconds but rather how the number of operations scales.

### **Common Time Complexities and Their Meaning**

1. **O(1) - Constant Time**

   - The execution time does not change with input size.
   - Example: Accessing an element in an array by index.

2. **O(n) - Linear Time**

   - The execution time grows in direct proportion to **n**.
   - Example: Iterating through an array with a loop.

3. **O(n²) - Quadratic Time**

   - Execution time grows as the square of **n**.
   - Example: A nested loop where each element is compared with every other element (like bubble sort).

4. **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time**

   - The execution time grows slower as **n** increases.
   - Example: Binary search (where we divide the problem into half at each step).

5. **O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time**

   - Slightly worse than linear but much better than quadratic.
   - Example: Merge Sort, Quick Sort (in average cases).

6. **O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Time**
   - Execution time doubles with each increase in input size.
   - Example: Recursive solutions to problems like the Fibonacci sequence (without optimization).

### **Key Observations from Code**

- **A single loop iterating n times → O(n)**
- **A nested loop (loop inside a loop) → O(n²)**
- **A loop reducing the problem size by half (like binary search) → O(log n)**
- **A loop iterating **n** times with another **log n** operation → O(n log n)**

### **Big-O Notation Simplification**

- We focus only on the dominant term and drop constants.
- Example: **(n² - n) / 2** simplifies to **O(n²)** since for large **n**, **n²** dominates **n**.

Would you like me to go deeper into any particular part, such as **asymptotic notations** (Big-O, Omega, Theta) or **examples of real-world algorithm complexities**?
