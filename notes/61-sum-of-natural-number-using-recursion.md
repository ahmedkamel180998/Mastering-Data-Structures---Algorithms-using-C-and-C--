### **Detailed Summary: Recursive Function for Sum of First N Natural Numbers**

#### **1. Introduction to the Problem**

- The goal is to find the sum of the first **N natural numbers** using **recursion**.
- **Definition**: The sum of the first **N** natural numbers is calculated as:  
  \[
  S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + N
  \]
- Example:
  - For **N = 7**, the sum is **1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28**.

---

#### **2. Recursive Definition**

- The sum of the first N natural numbers can be rewritten as:  
  \[
  S(N) = S(N - 1) + N
  \]
  - **Base Case**: If `N = 0`, return `0` (since natural numbers start from 1).
  - **Recursive Case**: For `N > 0`, use the formula `sum(N) = sum(N-1) + N`.

---

#### **3. Recursive Function in C++**

```cpp
int sum(int N) {
    if (N == 0)
        return 0;
    return sum(N - 1) + N;
}
```

- The function calls itself with **N - 1**, accumulating the sum until `N` reaches 0.

---

#### **4. Alternative Approaches to Solve the Problem**

There are three methods to find the sum of N natural numbers:

##### **Method 1: Recursive Approach (O(N) Time & Space Complexity)**

- Calls itself `N+1` times.
- Uses **stack memory** to store function calls.
- **Not optimal** in terms of space and performance.

##### **Method 2: Iterative Approach (O(N) Time & O(1) Space Complexity)**

```cpp
int sum_iterative(int N) {
    int S = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        S += i;
    }
    return S;
}
```

- **Advantage**: No recursion overhead, memory-efficient.
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since it uses only a few variables (`N, i, S`).

##### **Method 3: Mathematical Formula (O(1) Time & Space Complexity)**

\[
S(N) = \frac{N (N+1)}{2}
\]

```cpp
int sum_formula(int N) {
    return (N * (N + 1)) / 2;
}
```

- **Fastest method**: Runs in **constant time** `O(1)`.
- **No loops or recursion**, just a single mathematical operation.
- **Best for large values of `N`**.

#### **5. Comparing Different Methods**

| Approach             | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Recursion**        | `O(N)`          | `O(N)`           | Uses stack memory, slower for large `N` |
| **Iteration (Loop)** | `O(N)`          | `O(1)`           | More efficient than recursion           |
| **Formula**          | `O(1)`          | `O(1)`           | Best method, constant time execution    |

---

#### **6. Tracing the Recursive Function (Example: N = 5)**

1. `sum(5)` calls `sum(4) + 5`
2. `sum(4)` calls `sum(3) + 4`
3. `sum(3)` calls `sum(2) + 3`
4. `sum(2)` calls `sum(1) + 2`
5. `sum(1)` calls `sum(0) + 1`
6. `sum(0) = 0` (Base Case Reached)

Now, returning values:

- `0 + 1 = 1`
- `1 + 2 = 3`
- `3 + 3 = 6`
- `6 + 4 = 10`
- `10 + 5 = 15` (Final Result)

Total function calls = **N+1**.

---

#### **7. Drawbacks of Recursion in This Case**

- **Memory Usage**: Each function call requires stack space, leading to **O(N) space complexity**.
- **Performance Issues**: Recursive calls take extra time due to function call overhead.
- **Stack Overflow Risk**: For large `N`, stack space might exceed system limits.

#### **8. When to Use Each Approach?**

| Case                                          | Best Approach              |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Small `N` (e.g., `N < 100`)                   | Recursion is fine          |
| Large `N` (`N > 10^5`)                        | Use formula for efficiency |
| No recursion allowed (e.g., embedded systems) | Use loop                   |

### **9. Conclusion**

- **Recursion is useful** for understanding mathematical recurrence relations.
- **Iteration is better** in real-world scenarios due to lower memory usage.
- **Formula method** is the most **optimal** for quick computations.
