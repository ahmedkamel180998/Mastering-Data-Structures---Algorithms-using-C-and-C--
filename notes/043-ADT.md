## **Detailed Summary of the Transcript on Abstract Data Type (ADT)**

### **Introduction to ADT**

The video discusses **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** and explains its concept through the **List ADT** example. The explanation starts with the fundamental definition of a **Data Type** and then introduces **Abstract Data Type (ADT).**

### **Definition of Data Type**

A **data type** is defined based on two main aspects:

1. **Representation of data** â€“ How data is stored in memory.
2. **Operations on data** â€“ The set of actions allowed on the data.

#### **Example: Integer Data Type in C/C++**

- If an **integer** in C/C++ is assumed to occupy **2 bytes (16 bits)** in memory:
  - **1 bit** is reserved for the **sign** (to allow positive and negative numbers).
  - **15 bits** are used to store the actual number.
- Operations allowed on an integer in C/C++:
  - **Arithmetic operations:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
  - **Relational operations:** `<`, `>`
  - **Increment & Decrement operations:** `++` (pre/post-increment), `--` (pre/post-decrement)

Thus, a **data type** consists of both its **representation** and **operations** in programming.

### **Understanding "Abstract" in ADT**

The term **Abstract** means **hiding internal details** while allowing usage.

#### **Example: Integer Data Type Operations**

- While performing operations like addition or subtraction on an integer, **we do not need to know** how the operations are carried out in binary format in memory.
- We just declare an integer variable and perform operations on it without worrying about internal implementation.
- This abstraction allows us to use the integer data type without needing to understand how it works internally.

However, **this example is not ADT but a primitive data type**.

### **Introduction to Abstract Data Type (ADT)**

- ADT is related to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.
- With **classes** in OOP, we can define **custom data types** that are **abstract**â€”users can use them without knowing their internal details.
- **ADT combines both data representation and operations** while keeping implementation details hidden.

### **List ADT Example**

A **List** is a **collection of elements** stored in a sequence.

#### **Representation of a List**

To represent a list in programming, three essential components are needed:

1. **Space for storing elements**
2. **Capacity** (maximum elements that can be stored)
3. **Size** (current number of elements in the list)

Two possible ways to represent a list in a program:

- **Using an array**
- **Using a linked list**

Regardless of the internal representation, the user only interacts with the list operations without needing to know the internal implementation.

### **Operations on a List**

Several operations can be performed on a **List ADT**:

#### **1. Add an element (Append)**

- Adds an element to the **end** of the list.
- Example: Adding `x` to a list.
- Also known as **append operation**.

#### **2. Add an element at a given index (Insert)**

- Inserts an element at a specific index.
- Example: Insert `20` at index `6`.
- Other elements may need to be shifted to create space.

#### **3. Remove an element**

- Removes an element from the list at a given index.
- Example: Removing `20` from the list requires shifting remaining elements.

#### **4. Set at index (Replace an element)**

- Replaces an existing element at a specified index.
- Example: Replace value at index `3` with `25`.
- Also known as **replace operation**.

#### **5. Get element at index**

- Retrieves the value at a particular index.
- Example: Find value at index `5`.

#### **6. Search for an element (Contains key)**

- Searches for an element in the list and returns its index if found.
- Example: Searching for `9` returns index `2`.

#### **7. Sort the list**

- Arranges elements in ascending or descending order.

#### **8. Other operations**

- **Reverse** the list.
- **Merge** two lists.
- **Split** a list into multiple parts.

### **Final Thoughts on ADT**

- The **List ADT** is an example of **defining data representation and operations** together as a **data type** while hiding internal details.
- It can be implemented using **arrays** or **linked lists** in **C++ classes**, but users do not need to worry about internal implementation.
- **Other ADTs** include **Stacks, Queues, Graphs, Trees, and Hash Tables**, which will also be implemented as **ADT** in C++.

### **Conclusion**

- **ADT provides abstraction**, making data types easier to use while hiding complexity.
- In **Data Structures**, all major data structures will be represented as **ADT**.
- Future lessons will include **C and C++ implementations** of ADTs.

This concludes the **detailed summary** of the transcript on **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**. ðŸš€
